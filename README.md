# Geometry Playground
Hello :) This reposity is nothing serious, just a place for me to practice Rust! In this repo, I have created a library for creating different shape objects. These shapes have basic properties, like radius for Circle, and useful methods for making common calculations, such as getting the area of a Circle.

The main skills practiced here are file management in Rust library development, using/creating structs, enums and modules, and unit testing! Lots of unit testing!

Feel free to browse around or download and test for yourself! To run a test yourself, copy the library to your local machine, `cd` into the main project directory, and run `cargo test`! You must have `cargo` and `rustc` installed, of course. See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html" target="_blank">this link</a> for info on how to do that.
